TLS 1.3 implementations willing to negotiate TLS 1.2 MUST behave in accordance with the requirements of [RFC5246] when negotiating that version. In particular:[...]ECDSA signature schemes align with TLS 1.2's ECDSA hash/signature pairs.  However, the old semantics did not constrain the signing curve.  If TLS 1.2 is negotiated, implementations MUST be prepared to accept a signature that uses any curve that they advertised in the \"supported_groups\" extension.","TlsVersion":"TLS13","RFC":{"number":8446,"Section":"4.2.3.
