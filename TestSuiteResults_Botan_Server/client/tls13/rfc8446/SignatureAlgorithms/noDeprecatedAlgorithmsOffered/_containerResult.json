{"finished":true,"Score":{},"TestMethod":{"TlsVersion":"TLS13","TestDescription":"Note that TLS 1.2 defines this extension differently.  TLS 1.3 implementations willing to negotiate TLS 1.2 MUST behave in accordance with the requirements of [RFC5246] when negotiating that version. In particular:[...]In TLS 1.2, the extension contained hash/signature pairs.  The pairs are encoded in two octets, so SignatureScheme values have been allocated to align with TLS 1.2's encoding.  Some legacy pairs are left unallocated.  These algorithms are deprecated as of TLS 1.3.  They MUST NOT be offered or negotiated by any implementation.  In particular, MD5 [SLOTH], SHA-224, and DSA MUST NOT be used.","RFC":{"number":8446,"Section":"4.2.3.
