In that case, the client MUST send the same ClientHello without modification, except as follows: [...]Upon receiving a message with type server_hello, implementations MUST first examine the Random value and, if it matches this value, process it as described in Section 4.1.4). [...]Otherwise, the client MUST process all extensions in the HelloRetryRequest and send a second updated ClientHello. [...]Otherwise, when sending the new ClientHello, the client MUST replace the original \"key_share\" extension with one containing only a new KeyShareEntry for the group indicated in the selected_group field of the triggering HelloRetryRequest.
